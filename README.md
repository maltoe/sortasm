# sortasm

* Playing with sorting algorithms and x86 assembly.
* Most of the C standard implementations are copied from or heavily inspired by their correspondent Wikipedia articles.
* Almost all assembly implementations (except for Gnomesort and Heapsort) perform worse than their C counterparts.
* AA-Sort!
